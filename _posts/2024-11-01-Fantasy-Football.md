## Not Worth the Money
When NFL running backs reach the end of their rookie contracts, most teams are too scared to pay them the big money that comes with a second contract. Since running backs crash into crowds of 300 pound linemen all the time, they often get hurt, wear down, and end up running out of steam early in their careers.

NFL general managers weren’t the only ones afraid to trust these players. Anybody who plays fantasy football knows that older running backs were drafted way lower than they should have been. What were we afraid of? Old age? Injuries? Whatever it was, those fears have definitely not panned out.

## Proving Everyone Wrong
Last year, many teams refused to pay top dollar to their star running backs. Derrick Henry, Saquon Barkley, and many other star running backs had to find new teams to play for. And boy, it really seems like they're trying to prove everybody wrong. This year, we've seen total domination from these resurging stars. Just check out this incredible hurdle Saquon Barkley threw down a couple of weeks ago.

Running back is a position that gets lots of wear and tear. They run hard and get tackled frequently by 300-pound linemen. Typically, teams don’t like to use them after five or so years in the league. This year, we’re seeing a huge buck in this trend. So, what’s the deal? Is it true that running back hit a wall in their mid-twenties? Let’s take a look and see if we can get to the bottom of this fantasy football fantasy.
Before we try and bust this myth, we need to find some data. For this problem I found an awesome website called footballguys.com. (Screenshot of website)
As you can see, the data’s all here, nice and organized. However, it would be a real pain to try and go through all the different dropdown arrows and try and copy the data page by page. Instead of doing this, we can use a basic web scraping method. By using Beautiful Soup, we can easily loop through all the tables that we need and get them into a nice dataset.
(Insert table that has top 10 running backs in each year with drop downs)
(Average age of top 10 running backs over the past 25 years)
(Injuries)
(Recommendations for next year)
