## Sports and Numbers

When I was a kid, I would look up all the stats of NBA players, rank them, and then make up different teams of all stars. Then, I would go out to the court in my backyard. I’d somehow shoot all the shots for all players on both teams, announcing the games in my head and maybe redoing a shot or two when I missed. I LOVE sports. I also love numbers. When those two things meet, it’s heaven for me.

Enter fantasy football. This year, I joined a family league, and I have loved it. I’m obsessed.  For me, it’s the perfect mix of sports and numbers. As a statistics and sports junkie, I should be pretty good at it, right? Well, not so much. My team is 6-7 and will barely scrape by into the playoffs.

As I’ve learned new skills in my statistics classes, I’ve wanted more and more to use what I’ve learned to increase my fantasy football success next year. This blog has given me the perfect opportunity to practice my new skills on something I love.
In my last blog post, I gathered some data and did some exploratory analysis. I especially focused on the success of older running backs like Derrick Henry and Saquon Barkley. You should give it a read!

Now that I’ve gotten my feet wet, I’m ready to dive in more and see what insights I can discover. To do so, I used my data to build an awesome app in Streamlit! Streamlit is a great platform for building cool dashboards and visualizations. Using my fantasy football dashboard, you can look at any player and compare them to other players at their position. You can choose any statistic to look at, and you can even go back to 1996, just in case you want to compare current players to past success stories. (The link to my fantasy football dashboard, along with my repository with the code I used to create it, are at the bottom of the page).

To those who have given up on the playoffs and are ready for next year’s draft, let’s look ahead to two of next year’s biggest fantasy football questions.

      Top 10 Christian McCaffrey Plays of 2023
    </a>
  </p>
</div>

## Christian McCaffrey

Every expert, fantasy blog, and sports show had Christian McCaffrey as the number one overall fantasy prospect in every draft. He was far and above the best player in fantasy football the year before, and everyone expected that his production would continue.

However, just before the season, rumors started to surface about a possible injury. Originally thought to be ready to go for the season opener, McCaffrey has now missed 9 of 13 games this season, and just picked up a new injury that will keep him out for the rest of the season. Because of his injuries, he has been one of the biggest fantasy football busts of all time.
So, what do we do with him next year?

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

It is undeniable that when McCaffrey is healthy and on the field, he’s one of the best players in the NFL. The graph above shows his average fantasy points per game over his career. His peak of 30 points per game is unmatched by even Derrick Henry and Saqoun Barkley, widely regarded as the two best players in fantasy this year.

</div>

Sometimes, though, availability is the best ability, and availability is McCaffrey’s biggest problem. Out of the 8 seasons in McCaffrey’s career, three have been wrecked by injury. The bright side? We’ve seen him come back from injury before. After playing in only 10 total games through 2020 and 2021, McCaffrey came back strong, playing in 32 games over the next two seasons. Need further proof? Just watch the highlight video I linked above.

The verdict: How risk averse are you? McCaffrey is high risk, high reward. While it might be safer, there is no player in fantasy with a higher ceiling than Christian McCaffrey. If I were you, I’d still draft him inside the top 10 but would be scared to take him inside the top 5.

      Top 10 Tyreek Hill Plays of 2023
    </a>
  </p>
</div>

## Tyreek Hill

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

In 2023, Tyreek Hill had an outstanding season, breaking defenses with his incredible speed. This year, we’ve seen a meteoric fall. Tyreek has gone from 24 points per game all the way down to under 12, the lowest of his career. Part of the reason is that his quarterback was hurt for much of the season. Another is a nagging wrist injury he’s dealing with. However, I think the most interesting and impactful reason for next season is how teams have chosen to defend him.

To stop the big play threats of today’s NFL, teams are starting to employ a defense with two safeties, which limits deep throws and forces teams to make smaller chunk plays. Credit to [NFL Operations](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/stats-articles/how-defensive-schemes-are-shaping-the-nfls-passing-game-in-2024/#:~:text=According%20to%20Next%20Gen%20Stats,2019%20to%2063%25%20in%202024.), who wrote an article about the increasing frequency of this new look. The goal of the formation is to limit big plays down the side line, forcing the opponent to take more conservative plays. According to the NFL, the percentage of two safety looks has jumped from 44% in 2019 to 63% in 2024. Unfortunately, deep plays down the sideline are where Tyreek Hill kills with his cheetah-like speed. Because of this, no team faces this new defense more than Hill’s Miami Dolphins.

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

To illustrate this difference, we can look at Tyreek Hill’s average yards per reception. As you can see, Tyreek historically averages close to 15 yards per catch. This year, he’s down below 12. The last time he was this low was his last year with the Kansas City Chiefs, when teams famously tried more two safety looks to slow down the big throws from Patrick Mahomes to Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce.

Verdict: I would be very reluctant to draft Tyreek Hill next year. It seems like teams have figured out how to cut his deep plays off. Without the advantage of his speed, Tyreek likely isn’t built to beat teams in new ways. 

## Have a Good Draft
